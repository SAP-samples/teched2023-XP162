**Connect your SAP Business Application Studio with your Cloud Foundry Environment**

A connection of your SAP Business Application Studio to your Cloud Foundry subaccount is necessary if you want to deploy your application into your SAP BTP subaccount and make it available. 

**Preparation Steps**

2. Check the **API Endpoint** and **Org Name** and your **Space**.
